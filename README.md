# Icon creator

This is a simple tool to create svg icons, broadly following the [Lucide.dev icon design guide](https://lucide.dev/guide/design/icon-design-guide). It is built with React and Typescript.

It should be possible to design your icon using your mobile phone.

## Add this to your own project
I may push this to npm in the future, but for now, you can clone this repo and copy the relevant files (the ones in the iconCreator folder) to your project

If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
